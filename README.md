# java-tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that I have made using Java. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where two players compete on a three-by-three board. One player is assigned the "X" character and the other is the "O". These players must take turns and try to get three of their tiles in a line. The first player to do so will be crowned the victor.
